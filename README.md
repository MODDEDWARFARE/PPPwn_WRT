# PPPwn on OpenWRT

A method of running PPPwn on an OpenWRT-based router.

## Supported Routers

You can check to see if your router is supported [here](https://openwrt.org/toh/start).

## Prerequisites

Once OpenWRT is installed, you will need to temporarily connect the router to the internet. You can do this in the LuCI web interface by following these steps:

1. Go to **Wireless** settings and select the **Scan** option.
2. Select your network and join it as a client.

**WARNING:** Ensure your `br-lan` interface does not use the same subnet as your home network before joining as a client. Otherwise they will conflict.

## Setup

Remote into your router through SSH

Download the project to your router:

```sh
opkg update
opkg install unzip
wget -O main.zip https://github.com/MODDEDWARFARE/PPPwn_WRT/archive/refs/heads/main.zip
unzip main.zip
cd PPPwn_WRT-main
chmod +x install.sh && ./install.sh
```

Select your interface most common is `br-lan`.

Select your firmware 11.00 or 9.00.

You will be asked if you want to load the script on startup. If you select `Y` for Yes you can edit this in future by editing the file: `/etc/rc.local`.

You can now run the script from the terminal by entering `./run.sh` or run it from the LuCI web interface by going to **System > Custom Commands > PPPwn PS4 > Run**.

## Using a Button to Trigger the Exploit (1-click WPS button to run "run.sh") or Triger the process killer (Hold 3 sec WPS button to run "kill.sh")

This method is a bit more involved than the previous one.

1. SSH into the router and navigate to `cd /etc/rc.button`.

2. Type `ls` to list available buttons.

3. Find a button you want to replace, e.g., `wps`.

4. Edit the button script with:

    ```sh
    nano wps
    ```

5. Look for the `wps` button "released" code. It should look something like:
   ![WPS Button Code](https://i.imgur.com/ej8kr91.png)

6. Delete everything inside the `if` statement and replace it with the following command:
   
    ```sh
   if [ "$ACTION" = "released" ] && [ "$BUTTON" = "wps" ]; then
      if [ "$SEEN" -ge 3 ] ; then
         cd /root/PPPwn_WRT-main && ./kill.sh
      else
         cd /root/PPPwn_WRT-main && ./run.sh
      fi
   fi
    ```

   Example:

Now, when you press the `wps` button, it will run the script.

## LED Support

If your router has LED indicators for `wps`, `power`, `wlan`, etc., you can use them to indicate when the script is running.

1. Type `ls /sys/class/leds/` to list available LEDs.
2. Choose an LED, e.g., `red:info`.
3. Edit the script to change the LED behavior:

    ```sh
    nano /root/PPPwn_WRT-main/run.sh
    ```

4. Replace `green:wps` with `red:info` in:

    ```sh
    echo "heartbeat" > /sys/class/leds/green:wps/trigger
    ```

You can also change the LED behavior from `heartbeat` to:
- `none` = off
- `default-on` = always on
- `heartbeat` = blinking
- `timer` = time delay
